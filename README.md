# computer_science

This repository contains notes from my autodidactic study of Computer Science. As well as standard CS curricula it also houses notes related to my professional development as a software engineer. So there is a lot of practical content mixed-in, such as topics in DevOps, Git, shell scripting etc. I find it easier to have everything in one place and cross-referenced through YAML.
