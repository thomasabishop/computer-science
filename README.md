This repository contains notes from my autodidactic study of software
engineering and computer science.

It is a [Zettelkasten]() work in progress. I've recently converted the
topic-based subdirectories into a single flat directory structure organised by
tags. I'm in the process of partitioning longer notes into smaller informational
units.

I use the [zk](https://github.com/zk-org/zk) CLI package to help with indexing
and task automation alongside its [zk-nvim](https://github.com/zk-org/zk-nvim)
Neovim wrapper.
