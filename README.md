# Eólas

> Eólas is Irish for knowledge or information, especially knowledge gained by experience or practice

This repository contains notes from my autodidactic study of software engineering and computer science more generally. Along with theoretical topics it includes lots of practical content, typically syntax that I use day-to-day. 

It's designed to function as a second brain however this is more of an aspiration than a reality.
