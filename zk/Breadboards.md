# Breadboards

## Contact pins

- Beneath the plastic casing, the contact holes are connected to one another
  making a continuous circuit connection

## Terminal strips

The holes in the middle portion. They are connected in groups of five and
comprise two groups separated by the ditch. The terminal strips are not
connected accross the ditch thus each of the two strips are electrically
separate.
