# Signed magnitude representation

## Summary

## Detail

The concept behind SMR is similar to how we designate positive and negative
integers in denary mathematics: we use a dedicated symbol (`-`) to signpost that
the integer is negative. In the binary application the dedicated symbol is one
of the binary digits that comprise the number.

Typically `0` is used to indicate an unsigned (positive) integer and `1` to
indicate a signed (negative) number. The rest of the bits are the magnitude (the
actual numerical value).

We can demonstrate with an 8-bit binary system.
