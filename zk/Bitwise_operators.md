# Bitwise operators

In addition to mathematical, logical and comparison operators, there are
_bitwise operators_. These operators execute conditions based on the actual bits
of a value rather than the values that the bits are encoded to represent.

Bitwise operators are typically represented with single characters of existing
operators, e.g. `&` instead of `&&`:

| Bitwise operation | Operator      |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| AND               | `&`           |
| OR                | (single pipe) |
| NOT               | `~`           |

An example of using the `&` operator:

```py
x =5
y = 3
```
