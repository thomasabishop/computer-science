# Internet fundamentals

The internet is a _[network](Network_fundamentals.md) of networks_. A globally
connected set of computer networks that all use a suite of common
[protocols](Network_protocols.md).

The protocols governing the communication between networks on the internet are
specified in the **Internet Protocol Suite**.

This combines two protocols:

- **TCP**
  - The Transmission Control Protocol
- **IP**
  - The Internet Protocol

Hence the Internet Protocol Suite is also known as "TCP/IP".

The TCP/IP is a network stack comprising four layers. From the top:
