# Lists in Python

Lists are the equivalent of a simple array in JavaScript.

Lists have the following properties:

- They are **ordered**
- They are **mutable** and can be modified
- They **allow duplicate** members
- They are **indexed**
- You can increase/decrease their length by adding/removing new members
