# BBC Python Course notes

## Day 2

With lists you have to use copy if you wish to make a new version. You cannot just reassign to a new version. This will still update the original. Since it copies the pointer.

Distinguish functions that will create new list and methods which will modify existing list

Functions: named parameter passing, use for default parameter values

Python does not have constants but has a convention of upper case to mimic constants

With classes we don't need to use `new` when instantiating an instance of a class.

You do not need to define properties in classes if they exist in the constructor
