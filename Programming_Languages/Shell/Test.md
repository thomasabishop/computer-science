# Test in bash

`test` is a built-in command that is used to compare values or determine whether something is the case.

When we run a test the result we get back is a return status of a `0` or a `1`

We can use the command `test` but it is more common to test a condition implicity by using square brackets. The square brackets are an alias for `test`. We use this alias when we use `IF` logic
