# Relational database architecture

Tables, fields and records are the basic building blocks of databases

## Table

A group of similar data with rows for **records** and columns for each **field**.

## Record

A horizontal row: a collection of items which may be of different data types all relating to the individual or object that the record describes

### Field

A vertical column: stores a single particular unit of data for each record. Each field must use the same data type.

Each individual field has **properties:** such as the data type, length or the total memory allocation.
