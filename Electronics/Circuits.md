# Circuits

An electrical circuit is a set of electrical components connected in such a way that current flows in a loop from a voltage source, through the cirucit elements and back to the source.

Below is a basic circuit representing a 9-volt [battery]() with a 10,000$\Omega$ resistor attached accross its terminals.

## Open an short circuits

A circuit with a break in its loop is called an **open circuit**. When a circuit is open, no current flows.

A **short circuit** is a path in a circuit that allows current to flow with little or no resistance. This is usually unintentional and results in excessive current flowing through the circuit. A short circuit is the opposite to an open circuit. With an open circuit there is an infinite resistance between the two terminals.
