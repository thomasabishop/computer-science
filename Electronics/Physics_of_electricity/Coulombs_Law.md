# Coulombs Laws 

Coulomb's Laws express the fundamental relationship between charge, force and attraction. They are also known as the **Electrostatic Laws**.

## First Law 

> Like charges of electricity repel each other. Unlike charges attract each other. 

Within the atom we see this at work in the way that negatively charged electrons are attracted to the positively charged nucleus. This attractive force is balanced by the centrifugal force caused by the electron's rotation around the nucleus. This keeps the electrons in orbit. Without it, they would spiral into the nucleus. 

Within circuits, the first law dictates the movement of charge from negatively charged atoms to positively charged atoms through the conductor.
