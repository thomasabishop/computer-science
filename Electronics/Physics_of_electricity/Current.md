# Current

When an appropriate external force is applied, the movement of electrons is from negatively charged atoms (negative ions) to positively charged atoms (positive ions). We call this electrical current. 

We use the symbol $I$ to stand for current in equations. 

> The amount of current is the sum of the charges of the moving electrons past a given point.

We measure charge in Couloumbs.
