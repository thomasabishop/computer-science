# Prefixes for unit of electrical measurement

In electronics we are often dealing with units that are very large or very small, thus we rely on [exponents](/Mathematics/Algebra/Exponents.md) for formal expression.

| Prefix | Symbol | Expression as exponent | Expression as decimal value |
| ------ | ------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Giga-  | G      | $10^9$                 | 1,000,000,000               |
| Mega-  | M      | $10^6$                 | 1,000,000                   |
| Kilo-  | k      | $10^3$                 | 1,000                       |
| Milli- | m      | $10^{-3}$              | 0.001                       |
| Micro- | $\mu$  | $10^{-6}$              | 0.0000001                   |
| Nano-  | n      | $10^{-9}$              | 0.0000000001                |
| Pico-  | p      | $10^{-12}$             | 0.0000000000001             |

For example, with Amps we tend not to use 1 whole amp as this is far too large for most electronics. More common is the milliampere (mA) and the microampere ($\mu$A).

A mA is equal to one thousandth of an ampere: 0.001 A. It takes 1000 milliamperes to equal one ampere.

A $\mu$A is equal to one millionth of an ampere: 0.0000001 A. It takes one million micoramperes to equal one ampere.
