# Electrons

## Shells

Electrons orbit in concentric circuits around the nucleus of the atom. Each orbit is called a **shell**. 

Each shell can accomodate a maximum number of electrons. The shells are designated letters and filled in sequence moving out from the shell nearest to the nucleus.

## Valence 

The outer shell called the **valence shell** and the number of electrons it contains, the **valence**. This part of the electron is the most important from the point of view of electricity because it is from here that electrons can escape the atom and where electrons from other atoms may join.  

> The farther the valence shell is from the nucleus, the less attraction the nucleus has on each valence electron. Thus the potential for the atom to gain or lose elections increases if the valence shell is not full and is located far enough away from the nucleus.

## Conductivity and insularity 

The conductivity of a material is an expression of its capacity to channel electrical charge. Where electrical charge is the flow of free electrons from one atom to another. The insularity of a material is the opposite: its capacity to resist the flow of electrical charge. 

Electrons in the valence shell can gain energy from external forces. If these electrons gain  enough energy, they can leave the atom and become **free electrons**, moving randomly from atom to atom.

We call materials that contain a large number of free electrons **conductors**. In contrast **insulators** are atoms that stabilize themselves by absorbing valence electrons from other atoms to fill their valence shells, eliminating the free electrons. 

### Semiconductors 
Semiconductive materials are midway between conductors and insulators: they are neither good conductors or insulators but can be altered to function in the manner of either. 

## Ionization
