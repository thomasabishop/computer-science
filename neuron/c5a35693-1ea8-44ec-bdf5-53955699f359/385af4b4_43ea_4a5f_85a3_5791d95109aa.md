## _Paul Baran's concept of a distributed network and influence on architecture of the ARPANET_

Baran worked for RAND not ARPA and his work predated the commencement of the
ARPANET. However his model of a distributed network was highly influential on
the design of the ARPANET. He served as a consultant to ARPA during the initial
construction of the ARPANET.

Unlike ARPA, Baran was concerned with command and control and how a
communication network could be resiliant enough to withstand nuclear conflict.
He analysed the weaknesses in AT&T's telephone network.
