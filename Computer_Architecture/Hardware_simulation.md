# Hardware simulation

In order to test our [HDL](/Computer_Architecture/Hardware_Description_Language.md) files we load them into the hardware simulator program shown below:

There are several simulation options:

- interactive
- script-based (where we load a test script into the simulator along with the HDL file
- comparative (running the HDL program against our intended output specified in the `.out` file)
