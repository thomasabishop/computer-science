# Hardware Description Language

A HDL is a programming language used to describe the behaviour or structure of [digital circuits](/Electronics_and_Hardware/Digital_circuits/Integrated_circuits.md). They are used to simulate the circuit and check its response.

There are many HDLs but the most popular are VHDL ("very high speed integrated-circuit description language") and Verilog.
