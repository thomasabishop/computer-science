# Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

The ALU is the centerpiece or core of the [CPU](/Computer_Architecture/CPU/CPU_architecture.md) architecture, where the binary calculations occur. It comprises [logic gates](/Electronics_and_Hardware/Digital_circuits/Logic_gates.md) that execute the instructions passed from memory and where the data stored by the registers is acted upon.

It can execute arithmetic and logical operations on binary numbers. This is where you will find operations conducted by [full-adders and half adders](/Electronics_and_Hardware/Digital_circuits/Half_adder_and_full_adder.md) etc.

This is the heart of the CPU; all the other components on the CPU chip are appendanges to the execution that occures within the ALU. It is also what is meant by the **core** processor that is referred to in hardware specs of computers, for instance _dual-core_, _quad core_ etc.

Below is a schematic of a series of logical circuits within the CPU core:
