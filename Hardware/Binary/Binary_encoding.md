# Text encoding

## What is binary encoding

We know that everything going on in a computer is the manipulation of binary digits. Thus all data must ultimately reduce to binary numbers controlled through logic circuits. _Encoding_ is the process of establishing a correspondence between certain binary numbers and symbols. For certain essential data types, for instance alphanumeric characters and colours, there are agreed standards of encoding such that, for example, that (binary) and `3F` (hex) always corresponds to the character `?`.
