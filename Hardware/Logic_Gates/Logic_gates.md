# Logic gates

Logic gates are the basic building blocks of digital computing. **A logic gate is an electrical circuit that has one or more than one input and only one output.** The input controls the output and the logic is isomorphic with [Boolean connectives](../../Logic/Truth-functional_connectives.md) defined in terms of [truth-tables](../../Logic/Truth-tables.md).

> [A gate consists in] three connections where there may or may not be some electricity. Two of those connections are places where electricity may be put into the device, and the third connection is a place where electricity may come out of the device. (Scott, 2009)
