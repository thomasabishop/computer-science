Given the equivalence between factors and divisors we can increase fractions to higher terms in a very similar way to when we reduce fractions. In the latter case we are dividing by divisors to reduce. In the former, we are multiplying by factors to increase.

## Demonstration

*Express $\frac{3}{4}$ as an equivalent fraction having the denominator 20*

$$
\\frac{3 \cdot 4}{5 \cdot 4} = \frac{12}{20}
$$

*Express $\frac{2}{3}$ as an equivalent fraction having the denominator 21*

$$
\\frac{2 \cdot 7}{3 \cdot 7} = \frac{14}{21}
$$

## Increasing fractions with variables to higher terms

*Express $\frac{2}{9}$ as an equivalent fraction having the denominator 18a*

In these cases, just append the variable to the factor:

$$
\\frac{2 \cdot 2a}{9 \cdot 2a} = \frac{4a}{18a}
$$
