# AWS Lambda programming model

The overall architecure consists in the following three processes:

1. Triggers
2. Handler function
3. Code

## Triggers

See [AWS Lambda triggers](/DevOps/AWS/AWS_Lambda/Lambda_triggers.md)

## Handler function

See [AWS Lambda handler function](/DevOps/AWS/AWS_Lambda/Lambda_handler_function.md)

## Code

This is just the stuff that runs in the body of the handler or that is called from the handler body.
