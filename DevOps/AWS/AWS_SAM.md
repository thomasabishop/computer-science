# AWS SAM

SAM stands for **serverless application model**. It is a framework developed by AWS to simplify the process of building, deploying and managing serverless applications. It provides a concise syntax for defining the components of a serverless application, such as [Lambda functions](/DevOps/AWS/AWS_Lambda/Lambda_programming_model.md), [API gateway](/DevOps/AWS/AWS_API_Gateway.md) and database tables.

The SAM infrastructure is defined in a YAML file which is then deployed to AWS. SAM syntax gets transformed into CloudFormation during the deployment process. (CloudFormation is a broader and more robust AWS tool for large, highly scaleable infrastructures).

## Key features of SAM

- Single deployment configuration
- Integration with development tools
- Local testing and debugging
- Built on AWS CloudFormation

## Main technologies required

### Docker

Whilst SAM can be used to create a deployable file for AWS it can also be run as a container for local development with Docker.

### AWS CLI

This is installed using Python and allows you to interact directly with AWS via the command-line.

### AWS SAM CLI

See [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html)

## Setting up credentials for the AWS CLI

You require an access key for the given [IAM user](/DevOps/AWS/AWS_User_management_and_roles.md#iam). You should create an IAM account specific to the project with bounded permissions.

```
aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AK*******
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: ukp******
Default region name [None]:
Default output format [None]:
```

This information can be found in the Security Credentials section of the given [IAM](/DevOps/AWS/AWS_User_management_and_roles.md#iam) user:

## Starting a SAM project

First create a directory for your project which will serve as the repository:

```sh
mkdir aws-sam-learning
cd aws-sam-learning
```

Then we can use the `sam` cli to bootstrap the project:

```sh
sam init --runtime nodejs16.x
```

We can just click through and accept the basic HelloWorld Lambda.

This will create the Lambda as well as an API Gateway trigger URL.

### `template.yaml`

This is autogenerated and details the main constituents of the project. There are lots of fields but the most important are the following:

```yaml
HelloWorldFunction:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
  Properties:
    CodeUri: hello-world/
    Handler: app.lambdaHandler
    Runtime: nodejs16.x
    Architectures:
      - x86_64
    Events:
      HelloWorld:
        Type: Api
        Properties:
          Path: /hello
          Method: get
```

This details the location of the [handler function](/DevOps/AWS/AWS_Lambda/Lambda_handler_function.md) which is contained at the path `hello-world/app.js`:

```js
exports.lambdaHandler = async (event, context) => {
  try {
    // const ret = await axios(url);
    response = {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        message: "hello world",
        // location: ret.data.trim()
      }),
    };
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    return err;
  }

  return response;
};
```

It also lists the `get` event that we can use to call API Gateway and trigger the Lambda.

The full template is below:

## Adding our own code

We will create our own function and API Gateway trigger.

We will place our function after the existing `HelloWorldFunction`

```yaml
ClockFunction:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
  Properties:
    CodeUri: clock/
    Handler: handler.clock
    Runtime: nodejs16.x
  Events:
    ClockApi:
      Type: Api
      Properties:
        Path: /clock
        Method: get
```

Just like with `HelloWorld`, we will create a directory for this function: `clock` and we will initialise it as an `npm` project.

```sh
mkdir clock
cd clock
npm init
```

We will use `handler.js` as our root, handler function.

We have said in the template file that our `Handler: handler.clock`, therefore the main function in the `handler` module should be `clock`:

```js
const moment = require("moment");

exports.clock = async (event) => {
  console.log("Clock function run");
  const message = moment().format();
  const response = {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify(message),
  };
  return response;
};
```

The directory structure is as follows:

![](/_img/sam-directory.png)

When we call the API Gateway path `/clock` with `GET`, our function will be triggered.

## Deploying the project

We will now deploy our project to AWS from the local environment.

The process is as follows:

1. Build
2. Package
3. Deploy

### Build

We need to install the runtime dependencies for the function. We do this by running `sam build`. This ignores test files and development dependencies and installs the project dependencies and source files to a temporary subdirectory.

![](/_img/sam-build.png)

The build directory is `.aws-sam/build/`. There will be a subdirectory for each of our files.

### Package

As noted, CloudFront handles the deployment of the application. It can only receive one file as an input. The packaging process consists in creating that single file.

The packaging proces will first archive all of the project artefacts into a zip file and then upload that to [S3](/DevOps/AWS/AWS_S3.md).
