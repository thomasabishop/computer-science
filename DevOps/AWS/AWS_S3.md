# S3

You can think of S3 as an external mounted harddrive for storing raw binary data (images, soundfiles, documents etc).
Your use of the S3 service is divided up into **buckets**. Buckets contain files and resources.

The primary use of S3 is to store resources that an application needs and/or to facilitate the uploading and downloading of resources to and from an application.

You can set access and authentication conditions for buckets, making the data public or restricted.
