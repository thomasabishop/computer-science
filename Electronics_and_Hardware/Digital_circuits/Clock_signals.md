# Clock signals

When using multiple [memory devices](/Electronics_and_Hardware/Digital_circuits/Latches.md) in a complex digital circuit we need a way to ensure that all the bits are set at the same time. In the examples so far of [adders](/Electronics_and_Hardware/Digital_circuits/Half_adder_and_full_adder.md) and [latches](/Electronics_and_Hardware/Digital_circuits/Latches.md)
