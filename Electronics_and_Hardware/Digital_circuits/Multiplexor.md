# Multiplexor (MUX)

A multiplexor takes two inputs (A,B) plus a third input SEL (for "select"). Applying a value to SEL toggles the output between A and B.

Multiplexers can be used to build larger circuits by connecting the output of one multiplexer to the input of another. They are often used to implement data selection and switching in digital systems
