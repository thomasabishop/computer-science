In practice, neither worked consistently well with the carriage of tens remaining a sticking point.</p><p><img alt="Photograph of Arithmometer" src="static/arithmometer.jpg" /></p><p><img alt="Photograph of Comptometer" src="static/comptometer.png" /></p><p>The arithmometer (crank driven) and comptometer (key-driven) were descendents of the Leibniz design that became commercially viable by the 19th century along with other mechanical calculators.

In the same way as the mechanised looms created textiles. It is the extension of a model of industrial production from goods/commodities to information.</p><p>Babbage conceived two machines: the Difference Engine (DE) and the Analytical Engine (AE). Neither were successfully built in his lifetime. The DE preceded the AE and was basically an advanced mechanical calculator whereas the AE approximated a general purpose computer.</p><p>Despite this, with the Difference Engine, in contrast to preceding <em>aids to calculation</em>, the steps of the computational algorithm were no longer directed by human intelligence but by internal rules embodied in the mechanism and automatically generated.</p><h3 id="difference-engine">Difference Engine</h3><p>The DE’s single purpose was to calculate and output mathematical tables such as the results of polynomial equations. The idea was that you would input the answer a bell would ring and the machine would <em>halt</em>. This influenced Turing later. It was non-programmable and designed for a specific set of calculations.</p><h3 id="analytical-engine">Analytical Engine</h3><p>Conceived as a general-purpose computing machine capable of performing a wide range of calculations, programmable using punched cards similar to those used with Jacquard looms.</p><p>It more resembled modern computers in that Babbage used concepts that would later translate into the <span class="zettel-link-container cf"><span class="zettel-link" title="Zettel: CPU architecture"><a href="CPU_architecture">von Neumann architecture</a></span></span> There was a “mill” (CPU), “store” (memory) and input/output mechanisms. It also had a concept of looping and conditional branching.</p><h3 id="lovelaces-insight">Lovelace’s insight</h3><p>A central idea of Ada Lovelace, expressed in her notes on the Analytical Engine is that <strong>number can represent entities other than quantity</strong>.</p><p>If we assign meaning to number, results arrived at by operating on number according to rules can say things about the world when mapped back onto the world using the meanings assigned to them.</p><p>Lovelace’s insight was that the potential of computing lay in the power of machines to manipulate representations of the world contained in symbols.</p><h2 id="analogue-computers">Analogue computers</h2><p>Both digital and analogue computers are automatic. They differ in <em>how they represent quantities</em> and how their outputs are derived.</p><p>With digital machines, quantity is represented as a string of discrete digits.</p><p>With analogue machines, quantity is a physical property <em>in itself</em> rather than a representation. This could be, for example: the lowering of a weight, the flow of a liquid, or an electrical charge. This physical behaviour is <strong>analagous</strong> to the system that is being modelled. Quantities are continuously variable values rather than discrete (discontinuous values).</p><p>Digital machines produce results by <em>calculation</em> whereas analogue machines produce results by <em>measurement</em>, e.g. the height of liquid in a tank or the time it taks for a tank to be emptied.</p><h3 id="examples-of-analogue-computers">Examples of analogue computers</h3><h4 id="the-phillips-hydraulic-computer">The Phillips Hydraulic Computer</h4><p>This used fluid to model the workings of the British economy.

At the top of the board was a large tank called the treasury. Water (representing money) flowed from the treasury to other tanks representing the various ways in which a country could spend its money. For example, there were tanks for health and education. To increase spending on health care a tap could be opened to drain water from the treasury to the tank which represented health spending.</p><h4 id="bushs-differential-analyser">Bush’s Differential Analyser</h4><p>This was designed to solve differential equations by integration.

The codebreakers would be given a certain advantage using the Collosus (narrowing the field of possible deciphering keys) but still need to use manual methods to break the code. It made decipher time shorter rather than executing the full diciphering. In contrast to, say, the Bombe computer that would identify the key for the days transmissions.</p><p>It’s actual influence is also hard to gauge because of the secrecy that remained in place after the War.

Accuracy depended on myriad factors: gun elevation, shell shape and weight, explosive charge, distance, wind, temperature etc. Previously this had been done by human computers under the aegis of the Ballistic Research Laboratory.</p><p><img alt="The main control panel of the ENIAC" src="static/eniac.jpg" /></p><p>It was not completed until after VE day but was used at Los Alamos after the War and retired in 1955.</p><p>The BRL commissioned the Moore School of Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania for the construction of an automatic electronic calculator.</p><p>It used vacuum-tubes, along with switches and realys. It used decimal rather than binary and had punch card input and output.

Instead they were first used in hearing aids (1953) and transistor radios (1954).</p><p>From the mid-1950s onwards they started being used in military computers.</p><p>They had several advantages over vacuum-tubes: they were durable and reliable with no required startup time, they were power efficient and small.</p><p>The actual period where transistors alone were supreme in the form of a transistor board was relatively short-lived and rapidly gave way to ICs.</p><p>Computers of the transistor era had the following components separate from each other: the transistors, wired connections, resistors and capacitors. Integrated circuits put these all on the same piece of silicon.</p><p>They were first manufactured by Fairchild Semiconductor which was an offshoot of Shockley’s Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory.</p><p>The initial marked for ICs was military and scientific: the Minuteman ICBM and computers of the Apollo spacecraft.

This was sold preassembled with casing and required no soldering. It had expansion slots for third-party vendors to create compatible devices and had colour graphics.</p><p>The design of the Apple II was published in <em>Byte</em> in order to invite crowd-sourced plugins and extensions.
